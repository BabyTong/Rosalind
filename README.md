## ROSALIND ##

### Description
My solutions to bioinformatics problems found on the Rosalind website, worked primarily in Python.

Rosalind Website: [http://www.rosalind.info](http://www.rosalind.info)

### Repository Structure
The top level directory contains problem solutions.  The solutions are named by the numerical order of which they appear on the Rosalind website and by their Rosalind ID.

The scripts directory contains scripts for various processes which appear in multiple Rosalind problems but are not solutions to actual problems.

The data and output directories hold text files containing the data for each problem supplied by Rosalind, and the associated output from my solutions.  Only problems with long, unwieldy solutions are stored as text files.  Short solutions are printed in the console.
